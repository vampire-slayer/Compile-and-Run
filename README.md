# Compile-and-Run
A web tool (an Online Compiler and Debugging tool) built using HTML and PHP to compile and run C code using GCC compiler.
I created it during my first year at IIIT Allahabad.

Since the tool has been built using PHP, it needs to be hosted first. It can be hosted locally too (I mostly use XAMPP for hosting locally).

In the file 'compile.php', replace every instance of the path 'c:/mingw/bin/' with the path of GCC compiler on your Windows machine.
After this, you can host the webpages. The homepage is 'home.html'.
