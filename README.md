# compile-and-run
A web tool (using HTML and PHP) to compile and run C code using GCC compiler.

In the file 'compile.php', replace every instance of the path 'c:/mingw/bin/' with the path of GCC compiler on your Windows machine.
After this, you can host the webpages. The homepage is 'home.html'.

Note: The tool may not be fully foolproof at the moment. It is still a work in progress and I shall add more languages soon.
